Contriboost supports two types of plans: **Circle Payment (Contriboost)** for rotating savings and **GoalFund** for goal-based fundraising. Here’s how you can save or raise funds as a group:

##### Circle Payment (Contriboost): Rotating Savings Made Simple

**What is Circle Payment?**  
Circle Payment, also called Contriboost in the platform, is a rotating savings plan where participants take turns receiving the collected funds. It’s perfect for groups who want to save together and help each member reach their individual goals over time—like a modern take on a traditional savings circle (e.g., a "susu" or "tanda").

**How It Works**  
1️⃣ **Set Up Your Circle**  
Create a Contriboost plan with details like:  
- **Goal Name**: E.g., “Friends’ Savings Circle”  
- **Contribution Amount**: E.g., 0.01 ETH per person per cycle  
- **Cycle Duration**: E.g., 7 days per cycle  
- **Number of Participants**: E.g., 10 friends  
- **Start Date**: Pick a future date to begin  
- **Host Fee**: Optional fee for the organizer (up to 5%, e.g., 2%)  
- **Platform Fee**: Small fee for the platform (e.g., 0.5%)  
- **Missed Payment Rules**: E.g., max 2 missed contributions before a penalty  

2️⃣ **Choose Your Payment Method**  
Contribute using ETH or supported tokens (like USDT). All transactions are handled securely on the blockchain via smart contracts.

3️⃣ **Invite Your Group**  
Share a link to invite friends to join your Contriboost plan. It’s as easy as adding them to a group chat!

4️⃣ **Everyone Contributes**  
Each cycle (e.g., every 7 days), all participants contribute their share (e.g., 0.01 ETH). Contriboost tracks every contribution automatically on the blockchain.

5️⃣ **Rotate the Payout**  
Each cycle, one participant receives the total collected amount (e.g., 0.1 ETH for 10 people contributing 0.01 ETH each). The payout rotates to a different member each cycle until everyone has received their share.

6️⃣ **Stay Accountable**  
Smart contracts enforce the rules. If someone misses a payment, the plan’s missed payment policy applies (e.g., warnings or penalties), ensuring fairness without awkward conversations.

7️⃣ **Complete the Circle!**  
After all participants have received their payout, the Contriboost plan ends. Everyone has saved and received funds to use for their personal goals!

**Example**  
Ten friends join a Contriboost plan with a 7-day cycle, contributing 0.01 ETH each cycle. Each week, one friend receives 0.1 ETH (10 x 0.01 ETH, minus fees). After 10 weeks, all 10 friends have received 0.1 ETH to use for their goals—like buying a new gadget, paying off a bill, or funding a small project.

##### GoalFund: Raise Funds for a Specific Goal

**What is GoalFund?**  
GoalFund is a fundraising feature where participants contribute to a shared goal, like a group gift, community project, or personal milestone. You can create a GoalFund as either **Grouped** (for collective goals) or **Personal** (for individual goals), giving you flexibility to fundraise for any purpose.

**How It Works**  
1️⃣ **Choose Your GoalFund Type**  
- **Grouped GoalFund**: For collective goals where everyone contributes to a shared cause (e.g., a community project).  
- **Personal GoalFund**: For individual goals where friends support one person (e.g., helping a friend fund a medical expense).  

2️⃣ **Set Up Your GoalFund**  
Create a GoalFund plan with details like:  
- **Goal Name**: E.g., “Community Garden Fund” (Grouped) or “Help Sarah’s Medical Bill” (Personal)  
- **Target Amount**: E.g., 0.5 ETH  
- **Deadline**: E.g., 30 days from the start date  
- **Beneficiary**: The address that receives the funds (e.g., the group organizer or an individual)  
- **Token Type**: Choose ETH or a supported token  
- **Platform Fee**: Small fee for the platform (e.g., 0.5%)  
- **Tags (Grouped Only)**: Add tags to describe the goal (e.g., “community,” “charity”) to make it discoverable  

3️⃣ **Invite Contributors**  
- For **Grouped GoalFunds**, share the link publicly or with your group to attract contributors. These can be discovered by others on the platform.  
- For **Personal GoalFunds**, share the link privately with friends or family. These are not publicly listed.

4️⃣ **Collect Contributions**  
Participants contribute any amount they choose toward the goal (e.g., 0.01 ETH). Contriboost tracks all contributions on the blockchain, showing progress toward the target in real-time.

5️⃣ **Monitor Progress**  
- **Grouped GoalFund**: See how much has been raised and who contributed. If the goal is reached early, the fund can close.  
- **Personal GoalFund**: Contributors can see their individual contributions and the total raised for the beneficiary.

6️⃣ **Reach Your Goal!**  
- If the target is met by the deadline (or earlier), the funds are sent to the beneficiary’s wallet address.  
- If the deadline passes without reaching the target, the funds are either distributed (if the goal is achieved) or handled per the plan’s rules (e.g., refunded or sent to the beneficiary, depending on the setup).

**Example**  
- **Grouped GoalFund**: A neighborhood creates a “Community Garden Fund” with a target of 0.5 ETH and a 30-day deadline. Twenty people contribute 0.025 ETH each, reaching the goal in 10 days. The funds are used to build the garden.  
- **Personal GoalFund**: Sarah sets up a “Medical Bill Fund” to raise 0.3 ETH for a procedure. Her friends contribute varying amounts (e.g., 0.01 ETH, 0.05 ETH), and after 15 days, she reaches her goal and receives the funds.

#### Real-Life Examples

🌴 **Circle Payment for Savings**  
Ten coworkers join a Contriboost Circle Payment plan, contributing 0.01 ETH weekly for 10 weeks. Each week, one person receives 0.1 ETH (minus fees). By the end, everyone has received 0.1 ETH to spend on personal goals—like a new laptop or a weekend getaway.

🏡 **Grouped GoalFund for a Community Project**  
A group of neighbors creates a Grouped GoalFund called “Playground Renovation” with a target of 1 ETH. They tag it with “community” and “playground,” attracting 50 contributors who each give 0.02 ETH. The goal is met in 20 days, and the funds are used to renovate the local playground.

🩺 **Personal GoalFund for a Friend**  
John sets up a Personal GoalFund to raise 0.2 ETH for his sister’s medical expenses. He shares the link with family and friends, who contribute amounts like 0.01 ETH and 0.03 ETH. After 10 days, the goal is met, and the funds are sent directly to his sister’s wallet.

🎁 **Grouped GoalFund for a Surprise Party**  
Five friends create a Grouped GoalFund to throw a surprise party, aiming for 0.05 ETH. They tag it with “party” and “celebration,” and 10 people (including some mutual friends) contribute 0.005 ETH each. The goal is reached, and the funds buy decorations, food, and gifts for the party.
